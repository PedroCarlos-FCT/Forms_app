## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a system where users can manage forms dynamically, including creation, editing, responding, and storing responses securely.

## Functional Requirements

### Overview of the System

1. **View Forms**: Users can view a list of existing forms.
2. **Create Form**: Users can create a new form by providing a "name" and "description".
3. **Edit Form**: After creation, users are redirected to the form editing page to add questions.
4. **Question Types**: Questions can be multiple-choice, single-choice, or text.
5. **Add Questions**: Each question must include a type, title, description (optional), and answers (for choice types).
6. **Save Form**: Users should be able to save the form. After saving, they are redirected to the main page.
7. **Edit Existing Form**: Allow editing of existing forms by modifying existing content.

### Extras

1. **Respond to Form**: Users can respond to forms, not in edit mode, but as respondents (to test functionality).
2. **Response Storage**: User responses should be stored in a database, either locally or online.

### Technical Details

1. **Database Structure**: Define a simple database structure to store forms and responses.
2. **Stacks Reference**: ReactJS, Tailwind, NodeJS.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Usability**: Intuitive and user-friendly interface.
2. **Performance**: Quick responses to user actions, even with a large number of forms or questions.
3. **Security**: Implement security measures to protect form data and responses.
4. **Scalability**: Ability to support a growing number of forms.

### Running the App

1. **Install Dependencies**: First, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, navigate to the project directory and run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Development Server**: To start the development server, run:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command will compile the React code and start a development server. You can view the app by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

3. **Build for Production**: To build the app for production, run:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This command will create an optimized build of the app in the `build` directory.

### Additional Notes

- Make sure to configure Firebase for your project according to Firebase documentation. Update Firebase configurations in your project files if necessary.
- Ensure that Firebase is properly initialized in your React application for database integration.
- You may need to set up Firebase authentication and database rules according to your project requirements and security considerations.
